Create a web-based educational application designed for students under 5th grade to learn and visualize fundamental math concepts in an engaging and interactive way. The app should be intuitive, colorful, and user-friendly, with a focus on making abstract math concepts accessible through visualizations and interactive elements. The application should include the following features and requirements:

1. **Core Math Concepts**:
   - **Algebraic Operations**: Teach basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with interactive visualizations, such as draggable objects, number lines, or animated counters to demonstrate how numbers combine or break apart.
   - **Place Value**: Include an interactive module to explore place value (units, tens, hundreds) using visual aids like base-10 blocks, number charts, or place value grids. Allow users to build and decompose numbers to understand their structure.
   - **LCM and HCF**: Introduce Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Highest Common Factor (HCF) with simple, visual methods like number lines, factor trees, or interactive Venn diagrams to show relationships between numbers.
   - **Squares and Square Roots**: Provide a module for squares (e.g., visualizing 3Â² as a 3x3 grid) and square roots with interactive grids or animations to show the inverse relationship. Keep explanations simple and visual for young learners.

2. **Visualization and Interactivity**:
   - Use colorful, animated graphics and drag-and-drop interfaces to make learning engaging.
   - Include step-by-step tutorials with voiceovers or text prompts to guide students through each concept.
   - Provide interactive quizzes or games (e.g., matching games, puzzles) to reinforce learning after each module.
   - Ensure visualizations are dynamic, such as showing how numbers grow or shrink during algebraic operations or how place value blocks stack to form larger numbers.

3. **User Interface and Experience**:
   - Design a clean, responsive web interface optimized for desktops, tablets, and touch devices, with large buttons and simple navigation suitable for young children.
   - Use a playful, kid-friendly theme with bright colors, fun characters, or mascots to maintain engagement.
   - Include a progress tracker to show completed modules and reward students with badges or animations for milestones.

4. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Build the app using modern web technologies (e.g., HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Vue.js for interactivity).
   - Ensure compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
   - Host the app on a reliable platform with minimal latency for smooth performance.
   - Implement accessibility features (e.g., screen reader support, high-contrast mode) to accommodate diverse learners.

5. **Educational Approach**:
   - Align content with elementary math curricula for students under 5th grade, ensuring age-appropriate explanations and examples.
   - Use scaffolding techniques, starting with simple examples and gradually increasing complexity within each module.
   - Include hints and feedback for incorrect answers to encourage learning without frustration.

6. **Additional Features**:
   - Add a parent/teacher dashboard to track student progress, view completed activities, and suggest areas for improvement.
   - Include a "practice mode" with randomized problems for each concept to reinforce learning.
   - Allow customization options, such as adjusting difficulty levels or selecting specific topics for focused learning.

The app should prioritize simplicity, engagement, and visual learning to help young students grasp math concepts confidently. Provide a prototype with sample modules for algebraic operations, place value, LCM/HCF, and squares/square roots, ensuring each module is interactive and visually rich.
